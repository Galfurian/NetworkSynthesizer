# BEGIN of a channel tipologies database file in FORMAT_0.
# In this format, all lines beginning with an hash (#) or semicolumn (;)
#  character are comments thus, all these lines can be ignored.
# The format is meant to be:
#     1. a suitable interface to the core solver and possible extensions;
#     2. convenienlty human readable and light.
# Hint:
#     1. In order to display only the true (non-comment) lines:
#         $ grep "^[^#;]" input.txt
#     2. in order to display only the true data lines plus the tags:
#         $ grep "^[^#]" input.txt
#     3. in order to display only the comment lines:
#         $ grep "^[#;]" input.txt
# Remarks:
#     1. the format does not allow for empty lines
#     2. spaces and tabs are treated the same
# BEGIN the tipologies section: description of the C channel tipologies
# the tipologies section comprises C uncommented lines, one for each channel tipology
# the format is the following:
#   str           (int) (int)(int)(int)(int)(int)(int)(int)(bln)
;   label           id    K   KSU   S    E    DE   DL   ER   W
    bluetooth        1     5    0   25    1    6   12   10   1

    optic_cable      5    10  250  125   14    4    1    1   0
# where:
#     label : is just a name assigned to a channel tipology
#     id    : a unique id from 1 to C associated to each channel tipology
#     K     : is the cost of setting up a communication channel of type channel_label
#     S     : the total throughput capacity of the channel
#     E     : energy consumption of the channel.
#     DE    : energy consumption due to the contained data-flows.
#     DL    : transmission delay of the channel.
#     ER    : transmission error rate of the channel.
#     W     : a boolean attribute. Is the channel a wireless channel?
# END the tipologies section
