# BEGIN of a node tipologies database file in FORMAT_0
# In this format, all lines beginning with an hash (#) or semicolumn (;)
#  character are comments thus, all these lines can be ignored.
# The format is meant to be:
#     1. a suitable interface to the core solver and possible extensions;
#     2. convenienlty human readable and light.
# Hint:
#     1. In order to display only the true (non-comment) lines:
#         $ grep "^[^#;]" input.txt
#     2. in order to display only the true data lines plus the tags:
#         $ grep "^[^#]" input.txt
#     3. in order to display only the comment lines:
#         $ grep "^[#;]" input.txt
# Remarks:
#     1. the format does not allow for empty lines
#     2. spaces and tabs are treated the same
#
# BEGIN the tipologies section: description of the N node tipologies
# the tipologies section comprises N uncommented lines, one for each node tipology
# the format is the following:
#            str  int  int  int    int         int
;    label   id  cost size mobile nodePower taskPower
       pic   1      3    5     0    5        1
     board   2     10   25     1    8        1
# where:
#     label     : is just a name assigned to a node tipology
#     id        : a unique id from 1 to N associated to each node tipology
#     cost      : is the cost of buying a device of type node_label
#     size      : the processing capacity of the device
#     mobile    : a boolean attribute. Is the device mobile?
#     nodePower : is the intrinsic power consumption of the node.
#     taskPower : is the power consumed by a task placed inside the node.
# END the tipologies section
