# BEGIN of a node tipologies database file in FORMAT_0
# In this format, all lines beginning with an hash (#) or semicolumn (;)
#  character are comments thus, all these lines can be ignored.
# The format is meant to be:
#     1. a suitable interface to the core solver and possible extensions;
#     2. convenienlty human readable and light.
# Hint:
#     1. In order to display only the true (non-comment) lines:
#         $ grep "^[^#;]" input.txt
#     2. in order to display only the true data lines plus the tags:
#         $ grep "^[^#]" input.txt
#     3. in order to display only the comment lines:
#         $ grep "^[#;]" input.txt
# Remarks:
#     1. the format does not allow for empty lines
#     2. spaces and tabs are treated the same
